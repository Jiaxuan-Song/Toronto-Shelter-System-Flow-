# Tracking Homelessness in Toronto 

## Overview
This report is based on the Toronto Shelter System Flow dataset from Toronto Open Data, providing an in-depth analysis of how the city's homelessness services are functioning. The data offers valuable insights into the movement of people within the shelter system, helping to measure Toronto's progress in reducing homelessness. The goal of this analysis is to better understand the persistence and patterns of homelessness, ultimately providing evidence to support efforts to reduce homelessness to rare, brief, and non-recurring instances.
