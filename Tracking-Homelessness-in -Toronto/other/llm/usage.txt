I want to investigate the relationship between actively homeless and population group based on my dataset, please write r code and draw the plot.

Chatgpt:
ggplot(data, aes(x = population_group, y = actively_homeless)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +

User: 
I want to investigate the relationship between gender and population group based on my dataset, please write r code and draw the plot. Do not use the name from the cvs dataset directly, name a new name for the gender group. Make sure the plot will not overlapping.

Chatgpt:
data_long <- data %>%
  gather(key = "gender", value = "count", gender_male, gender_female, gender_transgender.non.binary_or_two_spirit) %>%

User:
I want to investigate the relationship between age group and population group based on my dataset, please write r code and draw the plot. Do not use the name from the cvs dataset directly, name a new name for the age group.

Chatgpt:
